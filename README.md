# Restaurant_Review

The Restaurant Review Solana project is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to submit, store, and view restaurant reviews on the Solana blockchain. Users can write reviews that include a title, rating, description, and location of the restaurant. These reviews are stored on-chain, ensuring immutability and transparency.

Key Features:
* Review Submission: Users can submit reviews for restaurants, including details like title, rating, description, and location.
* Blockchain Integration: Reviews are stored on the Solana blockchain, leveraging Solana's fast and low-cost transactions.
* Solana Program: The backend logic is powered by a custom Solana smart contract (program) that handles review submission, storage, and retrieval.
* Decentralized: No central server is required, and all data is stored in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency and trust.

This project uses Solana's fast and efficient blockchain to create an immutable review system for restaurants. It leverages Solana's smart contract functionality to ensure scalability, security, and user control over the review data.
